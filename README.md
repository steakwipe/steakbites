## digestible morsels of what it's like to be steakwipe


I constantly have trouble keeping track of my screenshots. Between the imgur-uploading-screenshot extension for Gnome, to just smacking PrtScr all the time, it's a mess.I take a LOT of screenshots. I'm going to start sharing them with everyone from here. I'll probably still use imgur too, but my extension should drop them here as well.

Most of these images, for the forseeable future, are going to be of Gnome3, and should exhibit increasingly customized themes.

I'll try to stick to the naming convention I came up with. Try.

It goes something like..

system-name_theme-name_descriptive-text.png

Underscores will separate the items there. Unless you have a better idea. Anyway, screenshot dump! Hit me up on twitter @stealwipe or pop into #ninjapirate on irc.freenode.net if you have any questions or concerns. Additionally, on Gmail I am steakwipe. If you can figure out how to send me an email, I'll reply to that too.
